## Project Description and Purpose
The final project for COP2080, Computer Science Problem Solving and Solutions.

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and interactive data anaylsis and modeling platform that enables users to seamlessly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model data using scientific calculations and data visualization tools. 

## Project Deliverables
**This project includes:**
* Audio samples from the hallway of the IST building at Florida Polytechnic University.
* A program written in python that:
    * Imports file data.
    * Provides data cleaning tools.
    * Analyzes provided data and generates summary statistics.
    * Displays models.
    * Reports the difference in RT60 time to reduce maximum voice intelligibility of 0.5 seconds.
* A final written report.

## Installation
This project requires the use of a python compiler. Install the package provided and run the "gui.py" file to start the analyzer. See "requirements.txt" for a list of required files and programs.

## Usage Guide
After installing and running the program, upload an audio file using the "load" button. The file will automatically be converted to wav format if it is not already in it. Utilize the other gui buttons to analyze the audio.

## Configuration
